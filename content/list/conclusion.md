In this guide, we walked through the process of listing all items in a DynamoDB table using the AWS Cloud Development Kit with Python. We created a Lambda function to handle the scan operation, and used the AWS SDK for Python to invoke the function and retrieve all items in the DynamoDB table.

With these tools and services, you can easily list all items in DynamoDB and build powerful applications that can handle large amounts of data and high levels of traffic.
