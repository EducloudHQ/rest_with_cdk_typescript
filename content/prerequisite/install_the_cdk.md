## Install the AWS CDK

To install the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have these installed, you can install the CDK using npm:

```
npm install -g aws-cdk

```

This will install the CDK globally on your machine. You can then use the `cdk` command to create and deploy AWS infrastructure as code.

For more information on getting started with the CDK, including setting up your AWS credentials and creating your first CDK app, see the [official AWS CDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html).
