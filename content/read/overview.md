## Create an API to Read a Weather Item from DynamoDB with CDK Python

This guide will walk you through the process of creating an API to insert items into DynamoDB using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) with Python.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- An AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Python and pip installed
- Basic knowledge of Python and AWS CDK

## Libraries used

The following AWS libraries are utilized:

- `aws_cdk`: This library is used to create and deploy AWS infrastructure as code using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK).
- `aws_cdk.aws_dynamodb`: This library is used to create a DynamoDB table to store the data.
- `aws_cdk.aws_lambda`: This library is used to create a Lambda function to handle the API requests and insert the data into the DynamoDB table.
- `aws_cdk.aws_apigatewayv2`: This library is used to create an API Gateway REST API to handle the API requests and forward them to the Lambda function.
- `boto3` is the official python software development kit for AWS. We'll be using `boto3`
to access all aws resources.
- `json`: The JSON library in Python is a module that allows you to encode and decode JSON data. It provides functions to convert Python objects to JSON strings and vice versa. It is typically used to exchange data between a client and a server over the web.
- `random`: This library is used to generate unique random numbers that are used to uniquely identify weather items.

Other technologies used in the process include:

- Python and pip: These are used to write and manage the CDK code.
- AWS CLI: This tool is used to interact with AWS services from the command line.
- AWS account: An AWS account is required to create and deploy the infrastructure.

The process consists of four steps:

1.  Create a Lambda function to handle the API requests and insert the data into the DynamoDB table.
2. Create an API Gateway REST API to handle the API requests and forward them to the Lambda function.
3. Create a lambda handler to perform our logic.
4. Test the API by sending POST requests to the API endpoint.
