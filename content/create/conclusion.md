## Conclusion
In this guide, we walked through the process of creating an API to `insert` weather item into `DynamoDB` using the `AWS Cloud Development Kit` with `Python`. 

We created a `DynamoDB table`, a `Lambda function`, and an `API Gateway REST API`, and `tested` the API using `Postman`. 

With these tools and services, you can easily create powerful APIs that can handle large amounts of data and high levels of traffic.
